After moving from parted magic to SystemRescueCD I decided to come up with my own set of packages to better fit my occasional tasks which involve booting from a flash drive.
The code works from within Arch Linux. To build an ISO:

    git clone https://github.com/shashurup/my-portable-arch.git
    cd my-portable-arch
    make

This is veeeery early alpha. The ISO would boot, however you wouldn't find anything interesting on it.
